# My Notes & Tasks

This is my personal knowledge base and task manager.
- Written in Markdown
- Synced with GitHub
- Organized into daily logs, projects, and tasks

## Structure
- `daily/` → day-to-day notes
- `projects/` → project-specific docs
- `tasks.md` → master to-do list
- `ideas.md` → random thoughts & snippets
